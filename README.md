# Dad jokes twitter bot

For this project I had a free evening and wanted to learn how to use Twitter's API to automate tweets. I found a useful libarary that queries numerous apis and returns a string with a funny joke in it - this project only took me an evening so I haven't added much functionality to it although I may come back to add to it as I have different uses for Twitter's API
